  <h1>R</h1>
  <p>created in 1993 by  based on <strong>S</strong>. specialised language free and open source</p>
  Here are some of the use cases of R used in
  <ul>
    <li>Data science</li>
    <li>Documentation</li>
    <li>Statistical Research</li>
    <li>Accademic Research</li>
  </ul>
  Benefits of using R
  <ul>
    <li>Free and Open Source</li>
    <li>lots of data analysis libraries</li>
    <li>highly extensible</Li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Download and install R</h2>
  Download R from <span class="link">https://cran.r-project.org</span> and install it. On windows download the base release and add the folder where R is installed upto <code>/bin</code> to the path variable on the System variables in the  System Environment Variables settings.
  <h2>Run R program</h2>
  Now that we have installed R, let's look at different ways we can run a simple R program below.
  <pre class="codeBlock prettyprint">
#print 'Hello World' to the Console
print("Hello, World")
</pre>
<h3>Using a Terminal</h3>
Open a terminal and type <kbd>R</kbd>, to run R interactively.
 You can write code and execute it directly in the Console.
 <h3>R GUI</h3>
 We can also use the R graphical user interface that comes with the installation of R.

 If you want to save your R code, save the file with <strong>.R</strong> as the file extention.

 You can run R code without saving the script and also directly in the console. You can even select the line(s) of code you wish to run.
    <h3>Using R Studio</h3>
  <p>R Studio is the number one IDE used for R development, download it from here <span class="link">https://www.rstudio.com</span>. </p>Open R Studio and select <code>File</code>, <code>New File</code> and then <code>R Script</code>. Just like in R GUI, you can ; run R code without saving the script, run code in the console. and also select the line(s) of code to run.
  <p><code class="prettyprint">#</code> - comments in R starts with the has character</p>
  <p><code class="prettyprint">print()</code></p>
  <p>There are other implementations of R (since R is open source), like Oracle R, etc. In this lesson we'll be using R
    maintained by the R Core team</p>
