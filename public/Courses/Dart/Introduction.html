	<h1>Dart</h1>
<p>General purpose programming language developed by Google.</p>
<h2>Install Dart</h2>
<p>You can write and run Dart programs online without installing anything by going to <span class="link">dartpad.dev</span></p>
<p>To write and run Dart programs locally on your computer, you'll need to install the Dart SDK. Go to <span class="link">dart.dev/get-dart</span> for instructions on how to  install Dart on your System.</p>
<p>If you want to manually download and install the Dart SDK, go to <span class="link">dart.dev/get-dart/archive</span>. Make sure you download from the stable channel and add the Dart SDK directory upto <samp>/bin</samp> to your path after installation.</p>
<h2>Run a Dart program</h2>
<p>Any code editor can be used to write a dart program. If the code editor you're using supports programming language extensions/packages search and install one for Dart. It will help you with syntax highlighting,debugging etc.</p>
<p>Create a new file, name it whatever you prefer with <strong><em>.dart</em></strong> as the file extension. Write the simple dart program code below in the file and save it.</p>
<pre class="codeBlock prettyprint">
void main(){

    print("Hello, world !");
}
</pre>
<p>To run the program, open a terminal window in the folder where your dart source file is and run <code>dart file.dart</code></p>
<p>The <code class="prettyprint">main()</code> function is the  programme execution entry point.</p>
<p>Curly brackets <code class="prettyprint">{}</code> are used to delimit a block of code.</p>
<p>A  semi colon <code class="prettyprint">;</code> is used to terminate a statement. It is required. </p>
