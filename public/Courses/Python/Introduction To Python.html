  <h1>Python</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Python</strong> is a High-Level, General purpose, Interpreted
    programming language created by Guido van Rossum. It was released in 1991
    and is named after the BBC Television Show '<em>Monty Python's Flying Circus</em>'.
    The Python Software Foundaton, A non-profit organisation manages resources
    for Python development.
  </p>
  <h3>Why Python</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>General purpose</strong> from Web Development, Shell Scripting, Data Science to Machine Learning; Python is suitable
        for different applications.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Open Source</strong> You can use it freely.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Easy To Read and Write</strong> Python has a simple Syntax that makes it easy read and write python
        code.It also makes it a great option
        for Beginners to Programming. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Popular </strong> Python is one of the most Popular Programming Languages its easy to get started in python , there's lots of resources and libraries. Python has a huge and friendly developer community</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Platform Independent </strong>Python works on different platforms , all you need is the Python
        Interpreter.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Multi-paradigm</strong> Unlike other Programming Languages</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Interface</strong> can be used as an Interface language. Code from low and faster programing languages like C can be imported into python program.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Installation</h3>
  <p>
    On windows you can install the latest version of Python from the Microsoft
    Store.

    On Linux or MacOS you can install the latest version of Python from the
    Package Manager(Homebrew on MacOS, on Linux, Linux Distributions use
    different Package Managers).
  </p>
  <p>
    Alternatively, you can go to <span class="link">https://www.python.org</span> and download a
    python installer for the <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> you're using.
    Don't forget to check the 'add to path' checkbox when installing python using the python installer..
  <p>
    Open the Terminal or Command Prompt and run
    <kbd>python --version</kbd> to check if Python was installed correctly..
  </p>
  <h3>Writing and Executing Python Programmes</h3>
  <p>There are several ways you can write and run a python program ...</p>
  Create a Folder on your Desktop, it is where you'll be saving the python Programmes.

  <h4>Using IDLE</h4>
  <p>
    Open the Pyhon Shell (IDLE).IDLE is a basic editor and interpreter
    environment which comes with the installation of Python.
    <img src="images/pythonShell.png" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <kbd>Ctrl/CMD + N</kbd> or click on File and then New File to create a new
    python file ...
    <img src="images/pythonShellNewFile.png" />
  </p>
  <h3>Sample Code</h3>
  <pre class="codeBlock prettyprint">
# My first python program
print("Hello World")
</pre>
  <p>
    Write the Sample Code on the Text Editor...
    <img src="images/pythonShellAndFileEditor.png" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <kbd>Ctrl/CMD + S</kbd> or click on File and then Save or Save As to save
    the python file. Choose the Python folder on the Desktop as the directory
    where to save the file. Name the file whatever you prefer with
    <em>.py</em> as the file extention, click save...
    <img src="images/newFileSave.png" />
  </p>
  <p>
    click <kbd>F5</kbd> or click Run and then Run Module to run the program
    ...
    <img src="images/runProgram.png" />
  </p>
  <p>
    The Output will be shown on the Python Shell...

  </p>
  <h4>Using Visual Studio Code</h4>
  If you don't have Visual Studio Code installed you can download it from <span class="link">code.visualstudio.com/download</span>. Open the python folder you
  created, right click, select <em>Open with Code</em>.
  <p>
    <img src="images/openWithVSCode.png" />
    Alternatively you can open VS Code and drag and drop the folder in VS Code.
  </p>

  <p>
    Click the New File icon to create a new file ...

  </p>
  <p>
    Name the file whatever you prefer with <em>.py</em> as the file extention,
    click Enter.
  </p>
  <p>
    Write the Sample Code ,<kbd>Ctrl/CMD + S</kbd> to save changes...

  </p>
  <p>
    Click Terminal , New Terminal to open a Terminal window.
    <img src="images/openTerminal.png" />
  </p>
  <p>
    To run a python Program on the Command-Line, you'll need to invoke the
    Python Interpreter on the program, for example :
    <samp class="code prettyprint">python program_name.py</samp> then <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run the
    program.

  </p>
  <p>
    The output will be shown on the Terminal.
    <img src="images/HelloOutput.png" alt="" />
  </p>
  <h3>Sample Code Simplified</h2>
    <p>
      <code class="prettyprint">#comment</code>: Comments in Python start with
      the hash character (#) and extend to the end of the line. Comments are not
      executed , they are mainly used to document the Code.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code class="prettyprint">print()</code>: The print function prints
      anything passed into it to the screen.
