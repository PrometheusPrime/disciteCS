    <h1>Markdown</h1>
    <p>
        Markdown is a Lightweight Markup Language with a readable plain text syntax. Markdown was created in 2004 by
        John Gruber with Aaron Swartz. It was designed to
        be simple to write and be human readable even if the Markdown Document is not rendered.
    </p>
    <p>Markdown is rendered to HTML, therefore HTML can be written inside Markdown. So if you want to do something that's not available in Markdown (or complicated), use HTML.</p>
    <h2>Useages and Advantages of Markdown</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Note Taking</strong> - markdown is usually used to take notes because of its simple syntax and the
            fact that even if a markdown document isn't rendered, its content can still be read.</li>
        <li><strong>Build a Website</strong> - Using a static site generator like Jekyll (<span class="link">jekyllrb.com</span>), you can create webpage from a markdown document.
                <br/>Some websites such as do allow users to format posts using markdown syntax.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation</strong> - markdown is widely used for writing documentations. On Github repository documentations are writen in markdown.</li>
        <li><strong>Presentation</strong> - There simple and easy to use tools like Remark (<span
                class="link">remarkjs.com</span>), Cleaver (<span class="link">jdan.github.io/cleaver</span>), Marp
            (<span class="link">marp.app</span>), etc, that you can use to create Presentations using Markdown.</li>
        <li><strong>Create Documents</strong> - You can create complex documents using markdown's simple syntax and and use a tool like pandoc (<span class="link">pandoc.org</span>) or VS code (using the 'Markdown-All-in-One' extension) to export that document to other formats like HTML, PDF,Microsoft Word, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to create a Markdown Document</h2>
    <p>Now that we've look at what markdown is and some of its usages and advantages, how do you create Markdown document? A Markdown document can be created
        using any simple text editor on any platform, just add <strong><em>.md</em></strong> as the file extension.</p>
    <p>In order to render the document, You'll need application that render a Markdown document. Search and install one
        for the OS you're using.</p>
    <p>If you're on a Mac, Windows or Linux, I recommend you use VS code. It supports Markdown out of the box.</p>
    <p>There are several flavours of Markdown. In this course we are going to look at the basic and Github flavoured Markdown. After learning the basics in this course, feel free to look at other implementations of markdown eg CommonMark.</p>
